Any values from those properties that cannot be\nused to influence the rendering of the UI control must not affect the\nrendering at all.\n\n For example, the UA should not draw a second border\naround a UI control that already has a border.\n\n If  \'background-color\'  or  \'background-image\'  have non-initial values and the UA\nis using their values for influencing the rendering of the UI control, then\nthe UA must ensure that the  \'color\'  property is\nalso used to influence the rendering.  \nSimilarly if <span class="property">\'color\'</span> is used to influence the rendering, then <span class="property">\'background-color\'</span> must be used to influence the rendering, and the other <span class="property">\'background-*\'</span> properties should be used to influence the rendering as well.\n \n Other properties must not affect the handling of  \'appearance\'  and must\ninstead be applied according to normal CSS rules. In particular  \'margin\' ,  \'display\' ,\n \'float\' ,  \'height\' ,  \'width\' , and\n \'line-height\' , are not ignored and affect the\nelement as normal.\n\n This specification does not define the term "platform".\n\n For example, it could be the native graphical rendering\nengine of the operating system, or it could be a user-agent-specific skin. In\naddition, which of several toolkits to use could also be decided on an\nelement-by-element basis depending on the values of the  \'background-color\' ,  \'background-image\' ,  \'border-*-style\' , and  \'outline-style\'  properties, so that the\nauthor styles could be honored while still honoring  \'appearance\'  even though the UA is unable to\ninfluence the rendering of OS native UI controls.\n\nNote.  The exact list of properties set\nby, influencing, and not affected by  \'appearance\'  given in the lists above may be\nadjusted based on UA implementor feedback.  \nAppearance values take into account the user interface state (if any) of\nthe element; thus there is no need for separate values for enabled vs.\ndisabled checkboxes for example.\n\n \n Example(s): \n Influencing the color and\nbackground-color of a button \n This example demonstrates setting the color and background-color of an\nelement that is set to \' appearance:push-button \'. \n sample CSS: \n \ninput[type=button] {\n  appearance:push-button; /* expected from UA defaults */\n}\n\ninput[type=button].custom { \n  color: #393;\n  background-color: #9cf; \n}\n \n sample (X)HTML fragment: \n \n<input type="button" value="Plain button" /> \n<input type="button" value="With color" class="custom" />\n \n A graphical browser might render\nthese buttons as follows: \n  First, a rounded button\nwith black text on a white background, with shades of gray being used near\nthe edges to give the impression of depth.     Second, a similar rounded button but\nwith blue text on a light blue background, and with shades of blue used to\ngive the impression of depth.  \n Your browser on your system: \n     \n \n 5.3.

Corner Shaping \nThe padding edge (inner border) radius is the outer border radius minus\n   the corresponding border thickness. In the case where this results in a\n   negative value, the inner radius is zero. (In such cases its center might\n   not coincide with that of the outer border curve.) Likewise the content\n   edge radius is the padding edge radius minus the corresponding padding, or\n   if that is negative, zero. The border and padding thicknesses in the\n   curved region are thus interpolated from the adjoining sides, and when two\n   adjoining borders are of different thicknesses the corner will show a\n   smooth transition between the thicker and thinner borders.\n\n  Note that this means that if the outer curve extends past the\n   adjacent corner's padding edge, the inner curve may not be a full quarter\n   ellipse.\n\n  All border styles (\u2018 solid \u2019,\n   \u2018 dotted \u2019, \u2018 inset \u2019, etc.) follow the curve of the border.\n\n   \n  \n The effect of a rounded corner when the two borders it\n    connects are of unequal thickness (left) and the effect of a rounded\n    corner on borders that are thicker than the radius of the corner (right).\n    \n   \n 4.4.2.  Corner Clipping \n \nThe effect of a rounded corner when the two borders it\n    connects are of unequal thickness (left) and the effect of a rounded\n    corner on borders that are thicker than the radius of the corner (right).\n    \n  A box's backgrounds, but not its  border-image , are clipped to the appropriate\n   curve (as determined by \u2018 background-clip \u2019). Other effects that clip\n   to the border or padding edge (such as \u2018 overflow \u2019 other than \u2018 visible \u2019) also must clip to the curve. The content\n   of replaced elements is always trimmed to the content edge curve. Also,\n   the area outside the curve of the border edge does not accept mouse events\n   on behalf of the element.\n\n   \n This example adds appropriate padding, so that the contents do not\n    overflow the corners. Note that there is no border, but the background\n    will still have rounded corners.\n\n    \nDIV {\n    background: black;\n    color: white;\n    border-radius: 1em;\n    padding: 1em }\n \n \n 4.4.3.  Color and Style\n   Transitions \nThis example adds appropriate padding, so that the contents do not\n    overflow the corners. Note that there is no border, but the background\n    will still have rounded corners.\n\n    \nDIV {\n    background: black;\n    color: white;\n    border-radius: 1em;\n    padding: 1em }\n \nColor and style transitions must be contained within the segment of the\n   border that intersects the smallest rectangle that contains both border\n   radii as well as the center of the inner curve (which may be a point\n   representing the corner of the padding edge, if the border radii are\n   smaller than the border-width).\n\n  The center of color and style transitions between adjoining borders is\n   at the point on the curve that is at an angle that is proportional to the\n   ratio of the border widths. For example, if the top and right border\n   widths are equal, that point is at a 45\xb0 angle from the horizontal,\n   and if the top is twice the width of the right the point is at a 30\xb0\n   angle from the horizontal. The line demarcating this transition is drawn\n   between the point at that angle on the outer arc and the point at that\n   angle on the inner arc.\n\n  It is not defined what these transitions look like, but a gradient is\n   recommended for color transitions that don't involve dotted or dashed\n   borders.\n\n   \n  \n Given these corner shapes, color and style transitions\n    must be contained within the green region. In case D the rectangle\n    defined by the border radii does not include the center of the inner\n    curve (which is a sharp corner), so the transition region is expanded to\n    include that corner. Transitions may take up the entire transition\n    region, but are not required to: For example, a gradient color transition\n    between two solid border styles might take up only the region bounded by\n    the tips of the outer radii and the tips of the inner radii (represented\n    in case D by the dark green region).\n   \n 4.4.4.  Overlapping Curves \n \nGiven these corner shapes, color and style transitions\n    must be contained within the green region. In case D the rectangle\n    defined by the border radii does not include the center of the inner\n    curve (which is a sharp corner), so the transition region is expanded to\n    include that corner. Transitions may take up the entire transition\n    region, but are not required to: For example, a gradient color transition\n    between two solid border styles might take up only the region bounded by\n    the tips of the outer radii and the tips of the inner radii (represented\n    in case D by the dark green region).\n  Corner curves must not overlap: When the sum of any two adjacent border\n   radii exceeds the size of the border box, UAs must proportionally reduce\n   the used value of all border radii until none of them overlap. The\n   algorithm for reducing radii is as follows:\n\n  Let  f  =\n   min( L i / S i ), where  i \n   \u2208 {top, right, bottom, left},  S i  is the sum of the\n   radii of the corners on side  i , and  L top \n   =  L bottom  = the width of the box, and\n    L left  =  L right  = the height of\n   the box. If  f  < 1, then all corner radii are reduced by\n   multiplying them by  f .\n\n  Note that this formula ensures that quarter circles remain\n   quarter circles and large radii remain larger than smaller ones, but it\n   may reduce corners that were already small enough, which may make borders\n   of nearby elements that should look the same look different.\n\n  If the curve interferes with UI elements such as scrollbars, the UA may\n   further reduce the used value of the affected border radii (and only the\n   affected border radii) as much as necessary, but no more.\n\n  The rendering of the box must be exactly the same as if the reduced\n   border-radius values were those originally specified.\n\n   \n For example, the borders A and D of the  figure below  might be the result of\n\n    \nbox-sizing: border-box;\nwidth: 6em;\nheight: 2.5em;\nborder-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em\n \n The height (2.5em) is enough for the specified radii (0.5em plus\n    2.5em). However, if the height is only 2em,\n\n    \nbox-sizing: border-box;\nwidth: 6em;\nheight: 2em;\nborder-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em\n \n all corners need to be reduced by a factor 0.8 to make them fit. The\n    used border radii thus are 0.4em (instead of 0.5em) and 1.6em (instead of\n    2em). See borders B and C in the figure.\n\n    \n  \n These rounded corner might be the result of \u2018 width: 6em; height: 2.5em; border-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em\n     2em \u2019 for A and D; and ditto but with \u2018 height: 2em \u2019 for B and C.\n    \n \n 4.4.5.  Effect on\n   Tables \nFor example, the borders A and D of the  figure below  might be the result of\n\n    \nbox-sizing: border-box;\nwidth: 6em;\nheight: 2.5em;\nborder-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em\n \nThe height (2.5em) is enough for the specified radii (0.5em plus\n    2.5em).

If  f  < 1, then all corner radii are reduced by\n   multiplying them by  f .\n\n  Note that this formula ensures that quarter circles remain\n   quarter circles and large radii remain larger than smaller ones, but it\n   may reduce corners that were already small enough, which may make borders\n   of nearby elements that should look the same look different.\n\n  If the curve interferes with UI elements such as scrollbars, the UA may\n   further reduce the used value of the affected border radii (and only the\n   affected border radii) as much as necessary, but no more.\n\n  The rendering of the box must be exactly the same as if the reduced\n   border-radius values were those originally specified.\n\n   \n For example, the borders A and D of the  figure below  might be the result of\n\n    \nbox-sizing: border-box;\nwidth: 6em;\nheight: 2.5em;\nborder-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em\n \n The height (2.5em) is enough for the specified radii (0.5em plus\n    2.5em).

If  f  < 1, then all corner radii are reduced by\n   multiplying them by  f .\n\n  Note that this formula ensures that quarter circles remain\n   quarter circles and large radii remain larger than smaller ones, but it\n   may reduce corners that were already small enough, which may make borders\n   of nearby elements that should look the same look different.\n\n  If the curve interferes with UI elements such as scrollbars, the UA may\n   further reduce the used value of the affected border radii (and only the\n   affected border radii) as much as necessary, but no more.\n\n  The rendering of the box must be exactly the same as if the reduced\n   border-radius values were those originally specified.\n\n   \n For example, the borders A and D of the  figure below  might be the result of\n\n    \nbox-sizing: border-box;\nwidth: 6em;\nheight: 2.5em;\nborder-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em\n \n The height (2.5em) is enough for the specified radii (0.5em plus\n    2.5em).

In case D the rectangle\n    defined by the border radii does not include the center of the inner\n    curve (which is a sharp corner), so the transition region is expanded to\n    include that corner. Transitions may take up the entire transition\n    region, but are not required to: For example, a gradient color transition\n    between two solid border styles might take up only the region bounded by\n    the tips of the outer radii and the tips of the inner radii (represented\n    in case D by the dark green region).\n  Corner curves must not overlap: When the sum of any two adjacent border\n   radii exceeds the size of the border box, UAs must proportionally reduce\n   the used value of all border radii until none of them overlap. The\n   algorithm for reducing radii is as follows:\n\n  Let  f  =\n   min( L i / S i ), where  i \n   \u2208 {top, right, bottom, left},  S i  is the sum of the\n   radii of the corners on side  i , and  L top \n   =  L bottom  = the width of the box, and\n    L left  =  L right  = the height of\n   the box. If  f  < 1, then all corner radii are reduced by\n   multiplying them by  f .\n\n  Note that this formula ensures that quarter circles remain\n   quarter circles and large radii remain larger than smaller ones, but it\n   may reduce corners that were already small enough, which may make borders\n   of nearby elements that should look the same look different.\n\n  If the curve interferes with UI elements such as scrollbars, the UA may\n   further reduce the used value of the affected border radii (and only the\n   affected border radii) as much as necessary, but no more.\n\n  The rendering of the box must be exactly the same as if the reduced\n   border-radius values were those originally specified.\n\n   \n For example, the borders A and D of the  figure below  might be the result of\n\n    \nbox-sizing: border-box;\nwidth: 6em;\nheight: 2.5em;\nborder-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em\n \n The height (2.5em) is enough for the specified radii (0.5em plus\n    2.5em). However, if the height is only 2em,\n\n    \nbox-sizing: border-box;\nwidth: 6em;\nheight: 2em;\nborder-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em\n \n all corners need to be reduced by a factor 0.8 to make them fit. The\n    used border radii thus are 0.4em (instead of 0.5em) and 1.6em (instead of\n    2em). See borders B and C in the figure.\n\n    \n  \n These rounded corner might be the result of \u2018 width: 6em; height: 2.5em; border-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em\n     2em \u2019 for A and D; and ditto but with \u2018 height: 2em \u2019 for B and C.\n    \n \n 4.4.5.

When \u2018 border-collapse \u2019 is \u2018 collapse \u2019, the UA may apply the border-radius\n   properties to \u2018 table \u2019 and \u2018 inline-table \u2019 elements, but is not required to. In\n   this case not only must the border radii of adjacent corners not\n   intersect, but the horizontal and vertical radii of a single corner may\n   not extend past the boundaries of the cell at that corner (i.e. the cell's\n   other corners must not be affected by this corner's border-radius). If the\n   computed values of the border radii would cause this effect, then the used\n   values of all the border radii of the table must be reduced by the same\n   factor so that the radii neither intersect nor extend past the boundaries\n   of their respective corner cells.\n\n  The effect of border-radius on  internal table\n   elements  is undefined in CSS3 Backgrounds and Borders, but may be\n   defined in a future specification.

    'box-flex':
{       'description': u'An element is flexible when the  box-flex  property is specified. The  box-flex  property is a\n   floating point value representing the flexibility of the element. Its\n   initial value is 0, which indicates that the element is inflexible.\n   Elements that are flexible can shrink or grow as the box shrinks and\n   grows. Whenever there is extra space left over in a box, the flexible\n   elements are expanded to fill that space. All flex is relative. For\n   example, a child with a box-flex of 2 is twice as flexible as a child with\n   a box-flex of 1. A negative value for box-flex is not allowed.\n\n  Flexible elements can be assigned to  flex\n   groups  using the  \u2018 box-flex-group \u2019 \n   property. This property is a natural number value (the first flex group is\n   1 and higher values are later flex groups). The initial value is 1.\n\n   In a horizontally oriented box, the preferred width of each child is\n   computed. If the width of the margin box of each child is equal to the\n   width of the containing block, then there is no extra space available, so\n   the preferred widths are used for each child. If the width of the margin\n   box adds up to a value smaller than the width of the containing block,\n   then extra space is available. This extra space is divided up among the\n   flexible children, as described below. If the width of the margin box adds\n   up to a value larger than the width of the containing block, then the\n   flexible children shrink as much as necessary to prevent overflow.\n\n   Flexibility only applies to elements in normal flow. As absolute and\n   fixed positioned elements are not in flow, any flexibility or flexgroup\n   specified on them is ignored. In addition, as the  \u2018 float \u2019 \n   property does not apply to children of flexible boxes, they are considered\n   part of normal flow and flexibility does apply.\n\n   When dividing up extra space, first take all elements within the first\n   flex group. Each element within that group should be given extra width\n   based on the ratio of that element\'s flexibility compared to the\n   flexibility of other elements within the same flex group.\n\n   However, if the preferred width of the element plus the extra width\n   allotted to it is larger than the maximum width of the element, then the\n   width is set to that maximum width, and any remaining extra width beyond\n   that is divided up among the other children.\n\n   \n  In this example there is 60 pixels of extra space available in the\n    containing box. \n \n    #div1 { display: box; width: 300px; }\n    #button1 { box-flex: 1.0; width: 100px; }\n    #button2 { box-flex: 2.0; width: 140px; }\n\n    <div id="div1">\n      <button id="button1">Hello</button>\n      <button id="button2">Goodbye</button>\n    </div>\n \n  As both child buttons are flexible, the extra space will be divided up\n    between them. The first child button has a flexibility of 1.0 and the\n    second child button has a flexibility of 2.0. The first button will\n    receive 20 pixels of extra width and the second button will receive 40\n    pixels of extra width, maintaining the same ratio of extra width to\n    flexibility values. This extra width is added to the preferred size of\n    the element. \n  However, if the second button had a maximum width of 150 pixels, it\n    could only grow by 10 pixels before hitting this maximum size, so the\n    remaining 30 pixels would instead be given to the first element, breaking\n    the flexibility ratio. \n \n In this example there is 60 pixels of extra space available in the\n    containing box. As both child buttons are flexible, the extra space will be divided up\n    between them. The first child button has a flexibility of 1.0 and the\n    second child button has a flexibility of 2.0. The first button will\n    receive 20 pixels of extra width and the second button will receive 40\n    pixels of extra width, maintaining the same ratio of extra width to\n    flexibility values. This extra width is added to the preferred size of\n    the element. However, if the second button had a maximum width of 150 pixels, it\n    could only grow by 10 pixels before hitting this maximum size, so the\n    remaining 30 pixels would instead be given to the first element, breaking\n    the flexibility ratio. More specifically, the percentage of extra space that an element may\n   receive is calculated as follows:\n\n  \u2018 box-flex of child \u2019 / \u2018 total of box-flex values of child and all siblings \u2019\n   \n\n   If the width of all flexible children within the group has been\n   increased to their maximum widths, the process repeats for the children\n   within the next flex group, using any space left over from the previous\n   flex group. Once there are no more flex groups, and there is still space\n   remaining, the extra space is divided within the containing box according\n   to the box-pack property.\n\n   If the box would overflow after the preferred width of the children\n   have been computed, then width is removed from flexible elements in a\n   manner similar to that used when adding extra space. Each flex group is\n   examined in turn and space is removed according to the ratio of the\n   flexibility of each element. Elements do not shrink below their minimum\n   widths.\n\n   If all children have been shrunk to their minimum sizes, then the box\n   overflows, although if the box-lines property is set to multiple, the box\n   may be able to move elements to additional lines to prevent this.\n\n   For vertically oriented boxes, the algorithm as described above is\n   similar except using the height instead of the width.\n\n   When a child box of a horizontally oriented box contains an inline\n   element, it is likely that shrinking the width of the element due to\n   flexibility may cause the inline element to grow in height, as the text\n   within it may need to wrap to additional lines.\n\n   \n  Examples: \n \n    #div1 { display: box; box-orient: vertical; height: 200px }\n\n    <div id="div1">\n      <button>Cat</button>\n      <button style="box-flex: 1">Piranha</button>\n      <button>Antidisestablishmentarianism</button>\n    </div>\n \n  In the example above, the box is 200 pixels tall and is more than\n    enough room for the three buttons. Because the first and third buttons\n    are inflexible, they remain the same size, which is their intrinsic size.\n    The second button is specified as being flexible, and because it is the\n    only flexible element in the box, it receives all of the extra space. \n \n    <div style="display: box; box-orient: vertical;">\n      <button style="box-flex: 1; height: 1000px;">\n        Cat\n      </button>\n    </div>\n \n  In this example, if the height of the box is reduced, for instance,\n    because the user resized the containing viewport, the height of the\n    flexible button also shrinks with the box, despite the specification of\n    1000 pixels as the preferred height. It continues to shrink until the\n    minimum required height for the button is reached, which here will likely\n    be the height needed to display the button\'s label and border. After\n    that, the button can shrink no further. Elements within a box can\n    therefore have their own notions of minimum and maximum intrinsic sizes.\n    In the above example, the button could not get any smaller than the\n    minimum height required to draw its borders and its text. \n \n    #div1 { display: box; }\n    #iframe1 { box-flex: 1; min-width: 100px; max-width: 300px; height: 300px; }\n\n    <div id="div1">\n      <iframe id="iframe1" src="http://www.mozilla.org/"/>\n    </div>\n \n  In this example, the iframe has a minimum width of 100 pixels and a\n    maximum width of 300 pixels. If the containing box is less than 100\n    pixels wide, the iframe will overflow its containing div. If the\n    containing box is between 100 pixels and 300 pixels inclusive, the width\n    of the iframe would be set to that size, minus any necessary padding,\n    borders and margins. If the width of the containing box is larger than\n    300 pixels, the extra space will be added inside the div. The extra space\n    is added after the iframe inside the box. \n \n    <p style="display: box;">\n      <button style="box-flex: 1; max-width: 50px;">Child 1</button>\n      <button style="box-flex: 1; min-width: 50px;">Child 2</button>\n    </p>\n \n In this example, the box has been stretched so that it is very wide.\n    The first child has a maximum width of 50 pixels, and it divides the\n    excess space equally with the second child until its maximum width has\n    been reached. After that, since it is not allowed to grow any further,\n    the remaining space all goes to the second child. \n \n 6  Packing along the box axis \n \n \n \n Name: \xa0\xa0\n\n      box-pack \n \n Value: \xa0\xa0\n\n      start  | end | center | justify\n\n     \n Initial: \xa0\xa0\n\n      start\n\n     \n Applies to: \xa0\xa0\n\n      box elements\n\n     \n Inherited: \xa0\xa0\n\n      no\n\n     \n Percentages: \xa0\xa0\n\n      no\n\n     \n Media: \xa0\xa0\n\n      visual\n\n     \n Computed\xa0value: \xa0\xa0\n\n      specified value\n   \n Examples: In the example above, the box is 200 pixels tall and is more than\n    enough room for the three buttons. Because the first and third buttons\n    are inflexible, they remain the same size, which is their intrinsic size.\n    The second button is specified as being flexible, and because it is the\n    only flexible element in the box, it receives all of the extra space. In this example, if the height of the box is reduced, for instance,\n    because the user resized the containing viewport, the height of the\n    flexible button also shrinks with the box, despite the specification of\n    1000 pixels as the preferred height.

If the width of the margin box adds\n   up to a value larger than the width of the containing block, then the\n   flexible children shrink as much as necessary to prevent overflow.\n\n   Flexibility only applies to elements in normal flow. As absolute and\n   fixed positioned elements are not in flow, any flexibility or flexgroup\n   specified on them is ignored. In addition, as the  \u2018 float \u2019 \n   property does not apply to children of flexible boxes, they are considered\n   part of normal flow and flexibility does apply.\n\n   When dividing up extra space, first take all elements within the first\n   flex group. Each element within that group should be given extra width\n   based on the ratio of that element\'s flexibility compared to the\n   flexibility of other elements within the same flex group.\n\n   However, if the preferred width of the element plus the extra width\n   allotted to it is larger than the maximum width of the element, then the\n   width is set to that maximum width, and any remaining extra width beyond\n   that is divided up among the other children.\n\n   \n  In this example there is 60 pixels of extra space available in the\n    containing box. \n \n    #div1 { display: box; width: 300px; }\n    #button1 { box-flex: 1.0; width: 100px; }\n    #button2 { box-flex: 2.0; width: 140px; }\n\n    <div id="div1">\n      <button id="button1">Hello</button>\n      <button id="button2">Goodbye</button>\n    </div>\n \n  As both child buttons are flexible, the extra space will be divided up\n    between them. The first child button has a flexibility of 1.0 and the\n    second child button has a flexibility of 2.0. The first button will\n    receive 20 pixels of extra width and the second button will receive 40\n    pixels of extra width, maintaining the same ratio of extra width to\n    flexibility values. This extra width is added to the preferred size of\n    the element. \n  However, if the second button had a maximum width of 150 pixels, it\n    could only grow by 10 pixels before hitting this maximum size, so the\n    remaining 30 pixels would instead be given to the first element, breaking\n    the flexibility ratio. \n \n In this example there is 60 pixels of extra space available in the\n    containing box. As both child buttons are flexible, the extra space will be divided up\n    between them. The first child button has a flexibility of 1.0 and the\n    second child button has a flexibility of 2.0. The first button will\n    receive 20 pixels of extra width and the second button will receive 40\n    pixels of extra width, maintaining the same ratio of extra width to\n    flexibility values. This extra width is added to the preferred size of\n    the element. However, if the second button had a maximum width of 150 pixels, it\n    could only grow by 10 pixels before hitting this maximum size, so the\n    remaining 30 pixels would instead be given to the first element, breaking\n    the flexibility ratio. More specifically, the percentage of extra space that an element may\n   receive is calculated as follows:\n\n  \u2018 box-flex of child \u2019 / \u2018 total of box-flex values of child and all siblings \u2019\n   \n\n   If the width of all flexible children within the group has been\n   increased to their maximum widths, the process repeats for the children\n   within the next flex group, using any space left over from the previous\n   flex group. Once there are no more flex groups, and there is still space\n   remaining, the extra space is divided within the containing box according\n   to the box-pack property.\n\n   If the box would overflow after the preferred width of the children\n   have been computed, then width is removed from flexible elements in a\n   manner similar to that used when adding extra space. Each flex group is\n   examined in turn and space is removed according to the ratio of the\n   flexibility of each element. Elements do not shrink below their minimum\n   widths.\n\n   If all children have been shrunk to their minimum sizes, then the box\n   overflows, although if the box-lines property is set to multiple, the box\n   may be able to move elements to additional lines to prevent this.\n\n   For vertically oriented boxes, the algorithm as described above is\n   similar except using the height instead of the width.\n\n   When a child box of a horizontally oriented box contains an inline\n   element, it is likely that shrinking the width of the element due to\n   flexibility may cause the inline element to grow in height, as the text\n   within it may need to wrap to additional lines.\n\n   \n  Examples: \n \n    #div1 { display: box; box-orient: vertical; height: 200px }\n\n    <div id="div1">\n      <button>Cat</button>\n      <button style="box-flex: 1">Piranha</button>\n      <button>Antidisestablishmentarianism</button>\n    </div>\n \n  In the example above, the box is 200 pixels tall and is more than\n    enough room for the three buttons. Because the first and third buttons\n    are inflexible, they remain the same size, which is their intrinsic size.\n    The second button is specified as being flexible, and because it is the\n    only flexible element in the box, it receives all of the extra space. \n \n    <div style="display: box; box-orient: vertical;">\n      <button style="box-flex: 1; height: 1000px;">\n        Cat\n      </button>\n    </div>\n \n  In this example, if the height of the box is reduced, for instance,\n    because the user resized the containing viewport, the height of the\n    flexible button also shrinks with the box, despite the specification of\n    1000 pixels as the preferred height. It continues to shrink until the\n    minimum required height for the button is reached, which here will likely\n    be the height needed to display the button\'s label and border. After\n    that, the button can shrink no further. Elements within a box can\n    therefore have their own notions of minimum and maximum intrinsic sizes.\n    In the above example, the button could not get any smaller than the\n    minimum height required to draw its borders and its text. \n \n    #div1 { display: box; }\n    #iframe1 { box-flex: 1; min-width: 100px; max-width: 300px; height: 300px; }\n\n    <div id="div1">\n      <iframe id="iframe1" src="http://www.mozilla.org/"/>\n    </div>\n \n  In this example, the iframe has a minimum width of 100 pixels and a\n    maximum width of 300 pixels. If the containing box is less than 100\n    pixels wide, the iframe will overflow its containing div. If the\n    containing box is between 100 pixels and 300 pixels inclusive, the width\n    of the iframe would be set to that size, minus any necessary padding,\n    borders and margins. If the width of the containing box is larger than\n    300 pixels, the extra space will be added inside the div. The extra space\n    is added after the iframe inside the box. \n \n    <p style="display: box;">\n      <button style="box-flex: 1; max-width: 50px;">Child 1</button>\n      <button style="box-flex: 1; min-width: 50px;">Child 2</button>\n    </p>\n \n In this example, the box has been stretched so that it is very wide.\n    The first child has a maximum width of 50 pixels, and it divides the\n    excess space equally with the second child until its maximum width has\n    been reached. After that, since it is not allowed to grow any further,\n    the remaining space all goes to the second child. \n \n 6  Packing along the box axis \n \n \n \n Name: \xa0\xa0\n\n      box-pack \n \n Value: \xa0\xa0\n\n      start  | end | center | justify\n\n     \n Initial: \xa0\xa0\n\n      start\n\n     \n Applies to: \xa0\xa0\n\n      box elements\n\n     \n Inherited: \xa0\xa0\n\n      no\n\n     \n Percentages: \xa0\xa0\n\n      no\n\n     \n Media: \xa0\xa0\n\n      visual\n\n     \n Computed\xa0value: \xa0\xa0\n\n      specified value\n   \n Examples: In the example above, the box is 200 pixels tall and is more than\n    enough room for the three buttons.

    'box-lines':
{       'description': u'By default a horizontal box will lay out its children in a single row,\n   and a vertical box will lay out its children in a single column. This\n   behavior can be changed using the box-lines property. The default value is\n   single, which means that all elements will be placed in a single row or\n   column, and any elements that don\'t fit will simply be considered\n   overflow.\n\n  If a value of multiple is specified, however, then the box is allowed to\n   expand to multiple lines (that is, multiple rows or columns) in order to\n   accommodate all of its children. The box must attempt to fit its children\n   on as few lines as possible by shrinking all elements down to their\n   minimum widths or heights if necessary.\n\n  If the children in a horizontal box still do not fit on a line after\n   being reduced to their minimum widths, then children are moved one by one\n   onto a new line, until the elements remaining on the previous line fit.\n   This process can repeat to an arbitrary number of lines. If a line\n   contains only a single element that doesn\'t fit, then the element should\n   stay on that line and overflow out of the box. The later lines are placed\n   below the earlier lines in normal direction boxes and above in reverse\n   direction boxes. The height of a line is the height of the largest child\n   in that line. No additional space appears between the lines apart from the\n   margins on the largest elements in each line. For calculating the height\n   of a line, margins with a computed value of auto should be treated as\n   having a value of 0.\n\n  A similar process occurs for children in a vertical box. Later lines in\n   normal direction boxes are placed to the right of earlier lines and to the\n   left in reverse direction boxes.\n\n  Once the number of lines has been determined, elements with a computed\n   value for box-flex other than 0 stretch as necessary in an attempt to fill\n   the remaining space on the lines. Each line computes flexes independently,\n   so only elements on that line are considered when evaluating flex and\n   flex-groups. The packing of elements in a line, as specified by the\n   box-pack property, is also computed independently for each line.\n\n   \n  This example shows four buttons that do not fit horizontally. \n \n    #div1 {\n      display: box;\n      box-lines: multiple;\n      width: 300px;\n    }\n    button {\n      box-flex: 1.0;\n      width: 100px;\n    }\n\n    <div id="div1">\n      <button id="button1">Elephant</button>\n      <button id="button2">Tiger</button>\n      <button id="button1">Antelope</button>\n      <button id="button2">Wildebeest</button>\n    </div>\n \n  The buttons are shrunk to their minimum widths, in this case\n    calculated intrinsically. Assume that the four buttons have a minimum\n    intrinsic width of 80 pixels. This will allow the first three buttons to\n    fit in 240 pixels with 60 pixels left over of remaining space. Because\n    the box-lines property has a specified value of multiple, the fourth\n    button may be moved onto a second line. \n  Flexibility is applied to each element, separately for each line. The\n    first line has 60 pixels of remaining space, so each of the three buttons\n    on that line will receive 20 pixels of extra width. The remaining button\n    on a line of its own will stretch to the entire width of the containing\n    box, or 300 pixels. \n  If the box was resized, the buttons may rearrange onto different lines\n    as necessary. If the style rules in the example above were changed to the\n    following: \n \n    #div1 {\n      display: box;\n      box-lines: multiple;\n      box-pack: center;\n      width: 300px;\n    }\n    button {\n      box-flex: 1.0;\n      width: 90px;\n      max-width: 90px;\n    }\n \n  Now, each of the buttons will only stretch to include an additional 10\n    pixels of width, as the maximum width of 90 pixels is only 10 pixels\n    larger than the minimum intrinsic width of the buttons. The remaining 30\n    pixels of space left over is divided up and placed inside the box outside\n    of the buttons, as the value of box-pack is center. The fourth button\n    will also appear at 90 pixels wide, centered within the box. \n \n 7.1  Multiple Lines and\n   alignment \n This example shows four buttons that do not fit horizontally. The buttons are shrunk to their minimum widths, in this case\n    calculated intrinsically. Assume that the four buttons have a minimum\n    intrinsic width of 80 pixels. This will allow the first three buttons to\n    fit in 240 pixels with 60 pixels left over of remaining space.

When the\n   computed box-direction is normal, a box will display its elements starting\n   from the lowest numbered ordinal group and ensure that those elements\n   appear to the left (for horizontal boxes) or at the top (for vertical\n   boxes) of the container. Elements with the same ordinal group are flowed\n   in the order they appear in the source document tree.

Omitted\n   lengths are 0; omitted colors are a UA-chosen color.\n\n  Where\n\n   \n <shadow>  = inset? && [  <length> {2,4} &&  <color> ? ] \nThe components of each  <shadow>  are interpreted as\n   follows:\n\n   \n The first length is the horizontal offset of the shadow. A positive\n    value draws a shadow that is offset to the right of the box, a negative\n    length to the left.\n\n    The second length is the vertical offset. A positive value offsets the\n    shadow down, a negative one up.\n\n    The third length is a blur distance. Negative values are not allowed.\n    If the blur value is zero, the shadow's edge is sharp. Otherwise, the\n    larger the value, the more the shadow's edge is blurred. See below.\n\n    The fourth length is a spread distance. Positive values cause the\n    shadow shape to expand in all directions by the specified radius.\n    Negative values cause the shadow shape to contract. See below.  Note that for inner shadows, expanding the shadow (creating\n    more shadow area) means contracting the shadow's perimeter shape. \n The color is the color of the shadow.\n\n    The \u2018 inset \u2019 keyword, if present,\n    changes the drop shadow from an outer shadow (one that shadows the box\n    onto the canvas, as if it were lifted above the canvas) to an inner\n    shadow (one that shadows the canvas onto the box, as if the box were cut\n    out of the canvas and shifted behind it).\n   \nAn outer box-shadow casts a shadow as if the border-box of the element\n   were opaque. The shadow is drawn outside the border edge only: it is\n   clipped inside the border-box of the element.\n\n  An inner box-shadow casts a shadow as if everything outside the padding\n   edge were opaque. The inner shadow is drawn inside the padding edge only:\n   it is clipped outside the padding box of the element.\n\n  If the box has a nonzero  \u2018 border-radius \u2019 , the shadow shape is\n   rounded in the same way. The \u2018 border-image \u2019 does not affect the shape of\n   the box-shadow.\n\n  If a spread distance is defined, the shadow is expanded outward or\n   contracted inward by an operation equivalent to applying twice the\n   absolute value of the spread value to a blur operation as defined below\n   and thresholding the result such that for a positive spread distance all\n   non-transparent pixels are given the full shadow color and for a negative\n   spread distance all non-opaque pixels are made transparent. The UA may\n   approximate this operation by taking an outward outset of the specified\n   amount normal to the original shadow perimeter. Alternatively the UA may\n   approximate the transformed shadow perimeter shape by outsetting\n   (insetting, for inner shadows) the shadow's straight edges by the spread\n   distance and increasing (decreasing, for inner shadows) and flooring at\n   zero the corner radii by the same amount. (The UA may even combine these\n   methods, using one method for outer shadows and another for inner ones.)\n   For corners with a zero border-radius, however, the corner must remain\n   sharp\u2014the operation is equivalent to scaling the shadow shape. In\n   any case, the effective width and height of the shadow shape is floored at\n   zero. (A zero-sized shadow shape would cause an outer shadow to disappear,\n   and an inner shadow to cover the entire padding-box.)\n\n  A non-zero blur distance indicates that the resulting shadow should be\n   blurred, such as by a Gaussian filter. The exact algorithm is not defined;\n   however for a long, straight shadow edge, this should create a color\n   transition the length of the blur distance that is perpendicular to and\n   centered on the shadow's edge, and that ranges from the full shadow color\n   at the radius endpoint inside the shadow to fully transparent at the\n   endpoint outside it.\n\n   \n The example below demonstrates the effects of spread and blur on the\n    shadow: \n    \n \nThe example below demonstrates the effects of spread and blur on the\n    shadow:  The shadow effects are applied front-to-back: the first shadow is on top\n   and the others are layered behind. Shadows do not influence layout and may\n   overlap other boxes or their shadows. In terms of stacking contexts and\n   the painting order, the outer shadows of an element are drawn immediately\n   below the background of that element, and the inner shadows of an element\n   are drawn immediately above the background of that element (below the\n   borders and border image, if any).\n\n  If an element has multiple boxes, all of them get drop shadows, but\n   shadows are only drawn where borders would also be drawn; see \u2018 box-decoration-break \u2019.\n\n  Shadows do not trigger scrolling or increase the size of the scrollable\n   area.\n\n   \n Below are some examples of an orange box with a blue border being being\n    given a drop shadow. \n \n \n \n \n \n      border:5px solid blue;\n   background-color:orange;\n   width: 144px;\n   height: 144px; \n    \n \n border-radius: 20px; \n \n border-radius: 0; \n \n \n \n      box-shadow:\n     rgba(0,0,0,0.4)\n     10px 10px; \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n      box-shadow:\n     rgba(0,0,0,0.4)\n     10px 10px\n     inset \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n      box-shadow:\n     rgba(0,0,0,0.4)\n     10px 10px 0\n     10px /* spread */ \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n      box-shadow:\n     rgba(0,0,0,0.4)\n     10px 10px 0\n     10px /* spread */\n     inset \n    \n    \n    \n \n \nBelow are some examples of an orange box with a blue border being being\n    given a drop shadow.The \u2018 box-shadow \u2019 property applies to the\n   \u2018 ::first-letter \u2019 pseudo-element, but\n   not the \u2018 ::first-line \u2019 pseudo-element.\n   Outer shadows have no effect on internal table elements in the collapsing\n   border model. If a shadow is defined for single border edge in the\n   collapsing border model that has multiple border thicknesses (e.g. an\n   outer shadow on a table where one row has thicker borders than the others,\n   or an inner shadow on a rowspanning table cell that adjoins cells with\n   different border thicknesses), the exact position and rendering of its\n   shadows are undefined.\n\n   7.

If no vertical value has been specified, the vertical\n   offset is set to zero.\n\n  If the \u2018 gr \u2019 unit or percentage\n   unit is used, it means that the middle of the float should be aligned with\n   the specified grid line (or portion thereof).\n\n  If another unit is used, it means that the float is pushed a distance\n   equal to the specified length.\n\n  \u2018 float-offset \u2019 is a good concept for moving\n   a float into the right position.

    'font-size-adjust':
{       'description': u'For any given font size, the apparent size and legibility of text varies\n   across fonts. For scripts such as Latin or Cyrillic that distinguish\n   between upper and lowercase letters, the relative height of lowercase\n   letters compared to their uppercase counterparts is a determining factor\n   of legibility. This is commonly referred to as the  aspect value . Precisely defined, it is equal to\n   the x-height of a font divided by the font size.\n\n  In situations where font fallback occurs, fallback fonts may not share\n   the same aspect ratio as the desired font family and will thus appear less\n   readable. The font-size-adjust property is a way to preserve the\n   readability of text when font fallback occurs. It does this by adjusting\n   the font-size so that the x-height is the same irregardless of the font\n   used.\n\n   \n The style defined below defines Verdana as the desired font family, but\n    if Verdana is not available Futura or Times will be used. \n p { \n    font-family: Verdana, Futura, Times; \n}\n\n<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ...</p>\n \n Verdana has a relatively high aspect ratio, lowercase letters are\n    relatively tall compared to uppercase letters, so at small sizes text\n    appears legible. Times has a lower aspect ratio and so if fallback\n    occurs, the text will be less legible at small sizes than Verdana. \n \nThe style defined below defines Verdana as the desired font family, but\n    if Verdana is not available Futura or Times will be used.Verdana has a relatively high aspect ratio, lowercase letters are\n    relatively tall compared to uppercase letters, so at small sizes text\n    appears legible. Times has a lower aspect ratio and so if fallback\n    occurs, the text will be less legible at small sizes than Verdana.How text rendered in each of these fonts compares is shown below, the\n   columns show text rendered in Verdana, Futura and Times. The same\n   font-size value is used across cells within each row and red lines are\n   included to show the differences in x-height. In the upper half each row\n   is rendered in the same font-size value. The same is true for the lower\n   half but in this half the font-size-adjust property is also set so that\n   the actual font size is adjusted to perserve the x-height across each row.\n   Note how small text remains relatively legible across each row in the\n   lower half.\n\n    \n Text with and without the use of font-size-adjust\n   \nText with and without the use of font-size-adjust\n  This property allows authors to specify an aspect value for an element\n   that will effectively preserve the x-height of the first choice font,\n   whether it is substituted or not. Values have the following meanings:\n\n   \n \n',
        'values': {       u'<number>': u"Specifies the aspect value used in the calculation below to calculate\n    the adjusted font size:\n     c  =  ( a / a' ) s \n \n where: \n s  =  font-size value\na  =  aspect value as specified by the font-size-adjust property\na' =  aspect value of actual font\nc  =  adjusted font-size to use\n \n This value applies to any font that is selected but in typical usage\n     it should be based on the aspect value of the first font in the\n     font-family list. If this is specified accurately, the  (a/a') \n     term in the formula above is effectively 1 for the first font and no\n     adjustment occurs. If the value is specified inaccurately, text rendered\n     using the first font in the family list will display differently in\n     older user agents that don't support font-size-adjust. \n",
